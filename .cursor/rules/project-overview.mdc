## General overview of the project in its CURRENT STATE
- Next.js App Router forntend: used to search and manage/track anime episodes on two selected websites (nyaa.si and hianime.to)
- Stream selected episodes without fully downloading in the browser. For streaming, MKV videos are used, but without subtitles (since they are not supported in browser)
- For streaming I use a deployed API that can serve/stream torrent videos

## Current goal of the project
- Convert existing Next.js App Router app to a Golang CLI app
- Golang CLI will mainly be used for searching only nyaa.si and track watched episodes
- To play the videos, CLI app will launch "mpv" video player installed on the system
