# Anitrack - track new episodes anime releases on nyaa.si and aniwave.to

## NOTICE: I'm abandoning this project because aniwave.to is currently requires too much effort to scrape (nyaa.si works though) which I'm not interested in. I may come back if I get into webscraping again.

The project was fully functional. However, after a few week break I noticed it doesn't work anymore. So, technically, I finished the project :)
Also, I already accomplished my main goals:

- Try out Golang and goroutines
- Try out deploying a Golang API to Railway
- Try out frontend technologies: Next.js App Router and server actions, Sentry, PostHog, Clerk, Upstash (ratelimiting), Drizzle ORM, React Query with server actions, etc.

## Setup

1. Setup Railway CLI
2. Run `pnpm install`

TODO:
