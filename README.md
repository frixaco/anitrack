# Anitrack - Simple anime release tracker for myself

It's a CLI app written in Go using [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework

## TODO

- [x] Add text input and a table with navigation support
- [x] Implement searching logic and populate results table with option to launch selected episode in [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/)
- [ ] Save watched episodes
- [ ] Save search keywords (since they are basically anime titles) and add autocomplete

<!-- ## TODO

- [ ] Add support for subtitles (MKV are not natively supported, but with ffmpeg+webassembly it might be possible)

## Setup

- Install Bun

```bash
bun install
bun dev -->

```

```
