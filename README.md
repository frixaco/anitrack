# Anitrack - track new episodes anime releases on nyaa.si and aniwave.to

## NOTICE: Ok, so, what if instead of trying to scrape aniwavet.to (mission impossible 8), i just use nyaa.si and add video player for it (wow, genius)

The project was fully functional. However, after a few week break I noticed it doesn't work anymore. So, technically, I finished the project? :)
Also, I already accomplished my main goals:

- Try out Golang and goroutines
- Try out deploying a Golang API to Railway
- Try out frontend technologies: Next.js App Router and server actions, Sentry, PostHog, Clerk, Upstash (ratelimiting), Drizzle ORM, React Query with server actions, etc.

## Setup

1. Setup Railway CLI
2. Run `pnpm install`

TODO:

- [ ] Integrate ntfy.sh for notifications
- [ ] Add UI for non-mobile screens
- [ ] Pallelize nyaa.si and aniwave.to scraping for better performance
- [ ] Improve overall UI
- [ ] Add video demo
- [ ] Setup autofix.yml for Golang API
- [ ] Show deployment url in Deployments section in project's Github page
